# JWI-WEEK-4

This is a website I designed using HTML and CSS. It is for the a Japanaese group based in Boston. This website is responsive on tablet, laptop, and mobile view as well. 

Working on this website was great because it is one of my first coding projects. Keeping it on Github will show me how I progress as I learn more about code.
